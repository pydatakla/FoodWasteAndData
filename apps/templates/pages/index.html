        <h4>Food Waste</h4>
        <p>
          Today, the world faces uncertainity of food security largely
          due to food wastage along the whole food supply chain.
          Over a third of all food produced (around 2.5 billion tons)
          is lost or wasted each year. One year of this occurs in the
          food production stage. Boston Consulting Group (BCG)
          estimates this wasted food is worht $230 billion.

          Researchers estimate the lost food calories from food waste
          amount to roughly 24% of the total available food calories.
          To put this in perspective, the UN reports that about a third
          of the global population, mostly in developing countries and
          low income countries, didn't have enough access to food in 2020,
          an increase of 320 million people from the previous year.

          According to UCU Mukono, food wastage makes up 65-79% of
          solid waste in landfills in Uganda causing environemental
          and health probleems. Globally, the problem is predicted
          to increase causing higher global food insecurity.
